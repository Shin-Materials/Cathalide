# Cathalide

Cathalide intends to modulate oragnic molecules in perovskite structures. Unlike inorganic materials, organic molecules are often considered as coarse grain. But conventional DFT codes cannot group atoms to form a group, which makes the operation of translation and rotation difficult.

This uses modified version of pymatgen functions. 
Currently, only VASP formats are allows (POSCAR) files, but Quantum Espresso will be soon to be implemented.

As of 2022,
the latest version of pandas has eliminated append function, where some features run into input/output error in some versions and OS. This will be resolved soon.
